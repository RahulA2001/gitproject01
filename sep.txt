Git is a widely used version control system that helps developers manage and track changes in their codebase. Whether you are working on a personal project or collaborating with a team, setting up a Git repository is the first step to using Gitâ€™s powerful features. This article will guide you through the process of setting up a Git repository, from installation to initialization and configuration.

Why Use Git?
Version Control: Track changes over time and revert to previous states if needed.
Collaboration: Work with others seamlessly by merging changes and resolving conflicts.
Backup: Keep your code safe by pushing it to remote repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
Branching: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.
